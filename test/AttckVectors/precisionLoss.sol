/*
In Solidity, precision loss refers to the inaccuracy that can occur when performing arithmetic
operations with integer types due to the lack of support for floating-point numbers.
Solidity, like many other programming languages used in blockchain development, 
operates primarily with fixed-size integer types, such as uint256, uint128, etc. 
These types cannot represent fractions, leading to potential precision issues in certain 
calculations.
*/

/*
When a contract is vulnerable to precision loss, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability 
to manipulate calculations involving integer arithmetic, typically multiplication and division,
to gain more tokens or funds than intended by the contract's logic. 
Hereâ€™s how an attacker can take advantage of such vulnerabilities:
